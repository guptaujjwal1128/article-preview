- Write clear, self-explanatory variable and function names.
- Keep functions pure and avoid side effects unless necessary.

- Add comments for complex logic or non-obvious code.
- Organize code in logical directories (e.g., components, utils, types).
- Avoid deeply nested code; refactor for readability.
